# Geometric Data Analysis project : Compressive K-Means

The paper **Compressive K-Means** proposes a compressive version of the K-Means algorithm, adapted to very high-dimensional datasets. The approach consists of constructing a **sketch**, a representation independent of the dataset size, and recovering cluster centers from the sketch using the CLOMPR (Compressive Learning Orthogonal Matching Pursuit) algorithm.

In this project, we will take up the guarantees given and experiments carried out by the authors of the paper, which we will objectively criticize through our own experiments in which we will compare the basic K-Means algorithm and the CKM algorithm.
